## Fedora Silverblue after-install scripts

These have been forked from https://github.com/castrojo/ublue so all thanks to Jorge for doing the groundwork. I have just modified his scripts to my needs.

- Vallery Lancey for a
  [wallpaper](https://www.flickr.com/photos/timewitch/51521513914/). We felt that
  a wallpaper from one of the Ubuntu community wallpaper contest winners would
  give us the vibe we're looking for. Plus it's called Silver Morning, what a
  brilliant coincidence!
